Description: Build multi-class pair-based (rule-based) classifiers using top-score pairs or random forest. This package provides a toolbox to train a single sample classifier that uses in-sample fetuare relationships. The relationships are represented in this ways feature1 < feature2 (e.g. gene1 < gene2). We provide two options to go with. First is based on switchBox package which uses Top-score pairs algorithm. Second is based on random forest algorithm. For simple problems we recommend to use one-vs-rest using TSP option due to its simplicity and interperity.  For complex problems RF performs better.  Both lines filter the features first then combine the filtered features to make the list of all the possible rules (i.e. rule1: feature1 < feature2, rule2: feature1 < feature3, etc...).  Then the list of rules will be filtered and the most important and informative rules will be kept. The informative rules will be assembeled in a one-vs-rest model  or in a RF model.  We provide a detailed description with each function in this package to explain the filteration and training methodology in each line.
